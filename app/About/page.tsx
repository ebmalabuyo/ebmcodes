Along with my education and intership experience, I have had the privilege of collaborating on projects for esteemed clients like UMV.MT and freelance projects on UpWork.

Halfway through my education at my university, I took an introduction to Computer Science course and that's where my passion for Software Engineering began. I picked up a minor in Computer Science and proceeded to take all the necessary classes (DSA, Database Systems, Systems Programming, Software Engineering, etc.) that would sharpen my technical problem solving. I enjoy all facets of Software Engineering, however, Front-end Engineering has always been the most facinating aspect to me as it allowed me to combine my creative outlook with my strong analytical capabilities."}
