        "description":"I developed and enhanced features on the mobile and web application for their language translation and instant messaging platform. The first phase of my internship involved designing an algorithm, then addressing various edge case scenarios and exploring potential optimizations and alternative approaches with other engineeers. After, I transitioned to the implementation phase, which involved integrating data collection functions into the migration workflow and interacting with an internal API to clean up orphaned data. I received valuable mentorship and expanded my knowledge in distributed backend architecture and reactive programming.",
